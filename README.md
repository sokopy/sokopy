Hi there, I guess. I am just another programmer in Github, nothing more nothing less. Perhaps a hacker in the future, but we'll see that later. I sometimes make dumb stuff here, like when I added a picture of a banana in one of my repos and changed the code so it will not work if the user deletes it.
