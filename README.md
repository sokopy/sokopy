Hi there, I guess. I am just another programmer in Github, nothing more nothing less. I sometimes make dumb stuff here, like when I added a picture of a banana in one of my repos and changed the code so it will not work if the user deletes it.
###### ~~I am totally not wanted in 2 countries for tax evasion and attempting to attack a military base~~





Anyways, if you wanna contact me, please send me an [e-mail](mailto:sokopy@mail2tor.com)




I know:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (websites and Node.js)
- Python
- A bit of Rust
###### I did not study them like a programming career
